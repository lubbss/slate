# Private API Introduction

> This is a sample GETBALANCE Request:

```shell
uiskPc9GqWAdUt1hJ+4VeuxyCNtbs0iY3kSbGQZ7HvwHkCe5H2n9UcX5v1Gl7Mb99XnhBiVzkne5bdkgmLdnlzzEBPLYnt8zwWHcqxXvIYiDpLQhsVfdkvyYwH1zgrUwAZu08VmY0ax34zxjXJdK68TVs9Y1m7akXkw5/NvIwXk=|635972931146604657|100012|22|<ENDOFDATA>
```

> The response is usually JSON-encoded:

```shell
rfV2ylPLbDbBKEy0yi71xZS/fZbyozd7+smpit1cR8ZeB0qo+stRDttTkCxqF0towkS0bf3lkg4amSbvka6K//QX/F1BHdFNqpkFXQHB9jh2eyR2WgXblKeGRbgw+mma+1P/kKNBtf3qhOUiqOgzONwlTEusiLzqHil6HLTQTKY=|635972681796848020|66|{"PrivReservedFunds":334.049,"MaxFunds":0.0,"PrivUsedFunds":207.12,"AvailableFunds":126.946}
````

> If there is an error, the server returns an error message starting with XError: for general errors or YError: if there was an error in a subtask of a bulk change order request.

The Fairlay Private API allows you to POST requests (creating/changing markets and orders, transfering funds, etc.), costs 0.1mBTC per 100.000 requests, see below on how to create your developer API account. 

This is the low level documentation, if you need a working sample or are more comfortable reading code rather than specifications, head over to [https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient] (https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient)

All requests must be send via TCP in the following format

 
`signature|nonce|userid|requestID|requestData<ENDOFDATA>`

Every request must end with 

`<ENDOFDATA>`

You must sign `nonce|userid|requestID|requestData` with your RSA key and provide your signature with all requests.

**Remember to use (YOUR API ID*1000)+Request ID on requests. Example: If you create your API accont on Fairlay, site will set an ID to it, usually first API ID is 1. So a request to Get Orderbook with this account will be 1001.**

# Private API Calls

## Get Public Key

```shell
signature|nonce|id|GETPUBLICKEY
```

Response: returns the server's public key in XML format.

## Create Account

```shell
<Exponent>AQAB</Exponent>
</RSAKeyValue>|999999
```

## Set Market Maker 

```shell
signature|nonce|userid|73|lmsrmarketmakerobject

> example for lmsrmarketmakerobject:

```shell
{"UserID":777888,
"Runner":5,
"Enabled":true,
"InitShareLimit":350.0,
"B":1300.0,
"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", 
"ShareStop":1400.0,
"InitProb":[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2],
"DiminishBack":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02],
"DiminishLay":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01],
"coolOffSeconds":36000.0,"coolOffFactor":4.0}
```

[https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient/blob/master/src/Private/Datatypes/LMSR.cs](https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient/blob/master/src/Private/Datatypes/LMSR.cs)

> Default values:

```shell
{"UserID":[userid],
"Runner":5,
"Enabled":true,
"InitShareLimit":300.0,
"B":1000.0,
"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", 
"ShareStop":9999.0,
"InitProb":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],
"DiminishBack":[0.00,0.00,0.00,0.0,0.00],
"DiminishLay":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01],
"coolOffSeconds":1.0,"coolOffFactor":2.0}
```
**UserID:** must match your userid **MarketID:** must be provided **Runner:** # of Runners / must match the # of runners of the market **Enabled:** must be set to true **InitShareLimit** (must be > 1): Shares that are offered in one order. Stake + Winnings from one order are 350mBTC **B** (must be > 10): ~ is about the same as the maxium possible loss of the market maker **CancelAll** (must be set to a future date): Date where the market maker stops. Set to year 2100 if the mm should run forever **ShareStop** (must be > 1): amount of exposure in shares before the market maker stops. Should be set higher than B in regular cases. **InitProb:** the initial probability estimation for all runners **DiminishBack** (must be non-negative): In general the LMSR market maker runs on 0% margin, i.e. it doesn't make any profit. If more margin should be added, you can worsen the odds for each bid orders for every runner. 0.01 worsens bid odds from 80% to 81% (or 1.25 to 1.2345) for example. **DiminishLay:** same for all ask orders.

*Cool off adds temporary additional margin to markets with increased activity and should be applied to markets that can have exogenous shocks or where real probabilities can deviate from the initial probability distribution. *

**coolOffFactor** (must be >=1): if set to 4.0 the odds will worsen 4.0 times more than expected from the usual lmsr market maker.
**coolOffSeconds** (must be >=1): The time after which the coolOff period will be over. If set to 36000 the additional market margin will reduce step by step over an period of 10 hours.

If no cool off is required, set coolOffSeconds to 1.

**Disable a MM by setting Enabled = false and other variables to a valid value.**

## Get Marker Maker

Gets the current LMSR MM from the user for a given market.

```shell
signature|nonce|userid|70|marketid
```

> example for lmsrmarketmakerobject:

```shell{"UserID":777888,"MarketID":61659266392,"Runner":5,"Enabled":true,"InitShareLimit":350.0,"B":1300.0,"CancelAll":"2016-06-05T13:34:56", "ShareStop":1400.0,"InitProb":[0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2],"DiminishBack":[0.01,0.01,0.01,0.0,0.02],"DiminishLay":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.01],"coolOffSeconds":36000.0,"coolOffFactor":4.0}```

## Change Market Closing Time

```

https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayDotNetClient/blob/master/src/Private/Datatypes/ChangeTimeReq.cs

Returns: MarketTime changed.

## Get Settlements

Gets all bankroll adjustments after a given time.

```shell
signature|nonce|userid|85|timeinticks
```

Returns: A JSON encoded Statement Object:

**long ID:** is not unique globally; is the time in milliseconds from Jan 1th 2016 **Descr:** optional description, contains the market ID in case of a settlement. **T:** 0-99 stands for a transfer (same like ttype in transfer object) includes deposits & cashouts, 100 admin, 200 market settlement w/o commission, 201 market settlement with commission, 250 unsettlement, 300 commission bonus) **Am:** amount credited **Bank:** total bankroll after the adjustment.

## Settle Market

Settles a given market. Note that the total betting volume of the market will be deducted from the available balance for 2 to 3 days. Unless the user has special rights, a user can only settle markets he created.

```shell
signature|nonce|userid|86|SettleRequestObject
```

> Example:

```shell
signature|nonce|userid|86|{
"Mid":77588905280,
"Runner":0,
"Win":1,
"Half":false,
"Dec":0.0,
"ORed":0.0}
```

**Mid:** is the market ID **Runner:** determines the Runner which won (0 means that the 1st Runner won, 1 means that the 2nd Runner won and so on). If a market shall be voided the Runner must be set to -1 **Win:** Must be set to 1 **Half:** should be set to "false". Only needed for +- 0.25 and +-0.75 soccer spread and over/under markets. If a market is half won or half lost, set Half to "true"; **Dec:** If the market is not binary, but has a decimal outcome, this needs to be set to the result. [Not supported yet] **ORed:** Odds reduction [only for Horse racing - not needed in general]

Returns: "Market settled" or some kind of "XError: ..."

# Public API Introduction

This is a free service to scrape all markets on Fairlay. For all POST requests (creating/changing markets and orders) use the paid [Private API](#public-api-introduction).

* The data on the free servers is updated every 5 seconds
* For Professional Users there exist private servers with an update frequency of half a * second. Please contact fairlay+api@protonmail.com to get access.
* You have to accept GZIP, DEFLATE in your HEADER
* Use the SoftChangedAfter parameter for incremental calls. Retrieve the server time and only query markets that have changed after your last request
* 12 incremental calls are allowed per minute (the SoftChangedAfter parameter must be set to not more than 30 seconds in the past)
* 1 call without a proper SoftChangedAfter parameter is allowed per IP per minute
* When using the markets request make sure that your URI is not too long
* All times are UTC (like DateTime.UtcNow, to account for any time difference with your developer machine grab [Server Time](#server-time), in the C# API all calls other than time will do this automatically for you)
* Strings are not case sensitive

For more examples how this API should be used together with our paid API, please take a look at our sample clients in C# and [Python](https://github.com/Fairlay/FairlayPythonClient/blob/master/client.py#L291).

Please feel free to comment and make suggestions.

# Public API Calls
